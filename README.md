# English Learning 3D Racing Game

Welcome to the 3DGame project! This repository hosts the codebase for an English learning racing game developed using Unity. Read the "Game_A2_22209269.pdf" file for detailed example views of the game. You can also watch the demo video [here](https://youtu.be/EI7ei9Z3iHo).

## Description

The aim of this assignment is to implement important techniques when creating a 3D game, focusing on English learning aspects.

### Key Features

- **Controls:** Players can control the direction of the car using W, A, S, D keys or arrow buttons.
- **Gravity and Physics:** Realistic gravity and physics are applied to the avatar and game objects, enhancing the realism of collisions and interactions.
- **AI Co-learning:** An AI avatar assists players by reacting to player behavior, providing samples on how to play the game, and offering hints.
- **Difficulty Levels:** The game offers two levels with increasing difficulty, featuring faster car speeds and more challenging vocabulary. A quiz follows each level to reinforce learning.
- **Sound Effects:** Immersive sound effects are incorporated to enhance the overall gaming experience.
